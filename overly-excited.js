// Practice: Stacking Words
// The learning objects of this exercise is to use iteration and string concatenation

// Create an addExcitement function that should console.log() rows of words. It should take an array containing the words of a sentence and output them in the developer console.

// Example output:

// The

// The walrus

// The walrus danced

// The walrus danced through

// The walrus danced through the

// The walrus danced through the trees

// The walrus danced through the trees in

// The walrus danced through the trees in the

// The walrus danced through the trees in the light

// The walrus danced through the trees in the light of

// The walrus danced through the trees in the light of the

// The walrus danced through the trees in the light of the moon ...

// Paste the following code into overly-excited.js

// Create an array that contains the words in the sentence
let sentence = ["The","walrus","danced","through","the","trees","in","the","light","of","the","moon"];

/*
    The addExcitement function should be an impure function, and accept
    the array as the sole argument. It should iterate over the array
    and output the words to the browser console.
*/
function addExcitement (theWordArray) {

    // Each time the for loop executes, you're going to add one more word to this string
    let buildMeUp = ""

    for (let i = 0; i < theWordArray.length; i++) {
        // Concatenate the new word onto buildMeUp
        buildMeUp += theWordArray[i] + " "
        if (i === theWordArray.length -1) {
            buildMeUp += "..."
        }

        // Print buildMeUp to the console
        console.log(buildMeUp)
    }

}

// Invoke the function and pass in the array
addExcitement(sentence)
